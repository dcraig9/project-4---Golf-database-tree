Some Questions about the project:

1.  Is the first BTNode - root -  filled with the first Player in the golferinfo.txt file?
	Aka the first golfer object?  
	Checked the book - yes this is how it is done.  Need to create a way to put first one as root.
	root = new BTNode(E element, null, null)
	Maybe read first data then put others in loop in main program.
	***Or more likely have TreeBag.add recognize the first one somehow?  Could check if root data == null;
	Then add if so.

2.  Are subsequent golfer objects added using the TreeBag.add(E) method?
	Will this align them in the tree?  Is it by alphabetical of last name?
	Comparisons will determine whether it is left or right of root.



3. DisplayAsTree relies on BTNode print.  So the toString() for Golfer Data is needed.
	"data" is printed = golfer object info - should we do it as One line? Or multiple lines of info?
